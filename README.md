# README
These are guided Python projects done for an algorithms class.

These projects use Python 2.7 and were originally created in a text editor and then run on the command line.

##Files
There are three small programs.

1. Dijkstra Shortest Path
  + This program finds the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
  + The student implementation is found in "myGraph.py".
2. Sorting Runtime
  + This program implements different sorting algorithms and then calculates the runtime to compare avg runtime of each algorithm.
  + The student implementation is found in "mySortingFunctions.py".
3. Trie
  + This program takes a populated trie and then returns the appropriate strings that contain an input prefix.

##Note
+ These projects are possibly still being used by the class and will be removed at my discretion if requested by the professor and institution.
